    This...probably doesn't do what we want just yet. Games won't be assigned
    the correct index unless everyone has stats on every game.

    For example: A freshman in 2017 has the first game of the 2017 season
    listed as 0, while a Sophomore might have that listed as 30. Without
    consistency, we can't reason about the data. Maybe we should learn about
    Pandas' time series features...

    2017-09-09: I have modified our parser to include dates, at the expense of
    simple plotting. Pandas understands dates very well, and it takes a gap in
    dates to mean a gap in data. This gap carries over into plots, making it
    look very bad. To fix this, we can reset the index (df.reset_index()) to
    temporarily get the 0..n index back. This allows plotting the way it worked
    before, but with one extra step. (See below in __main__.)

    For single player analysis, this is nice. For multi-player analysis, we
    will need to be careful, but having the dates is crucial.
